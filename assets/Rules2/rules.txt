# lines starting with # or // are comments
# all other lines will be parsed and treated as filenames.

# Feel free to comment out certain rules, to see if and how they are working.
# So have fun experimenting with this bunch of rules :)

# First apply only one tile rules to fill the regions
#
# We mark the place, where rules are defined, with the RuleRegion layer.
# So whereever there are tiles at the ruleRegion layer, it will be used as a rule.
# In the RuleSet layer we can define, which combination of tiles must occur
# to trigger the specific rule.
# The layers Rule_Ground, Rule_Over and Rule_Over2 define the output of the rules.
#
# Which tiles should I use in the regions layer?
# Actually there can be any tiles, but it should be the same tiles for one rule.
# So use whatever you want, maybe a colorful tile so you can see easily that these
# tiles are used for defining the rule region.
#
# In the very first rulefile used for Automapping it might be useful to define
# some map properties:
# "DeleteTiles" = "true", "false" - This property determines if all tiles in the
#                                   whole region where Automapping takes place
#                                   are deleted.
#                                   That is useful, when not all layers are covered
#                                   at all places. (Check the Over and Over2 layer!)
# "AutoMappingRadius" = 0,1,2...  - This property determines which regions are
#                                   automatically remapped at live Automapping.
#                                   When you draw directly into the map,
#                                   not the whole map is remapped, but only a little
#                                   place around. Here you can specify how many
#                                   tiles at least should be remapped.
